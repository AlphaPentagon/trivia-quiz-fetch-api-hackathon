# Week 2 Hackathon

## Movie Trivia Quiz using the Fetch API

At the end of our second week on the School of Code bootcamp, we were tasked with creating an app that fetched data from an external api and then allows users to interact with it in a browser using vanilla JS.

As a team of three, we built a movie trivia app using vanilla JS, html and css.

This exercise taught me the importance of fetching data asynchronously and querying the DOM to select and alter HTML elements.
